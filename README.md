# Stock Watcher

Your task is to build a simple web application for a user to add basic stock tickers to a dashboard. To add a stock, the user enters the symbol of their desired stock eg. "GOOG" or "YHOO" into a text field. When they click "Add" the basic stock data is added to the dashboard.

Use the following API to retrieve your stock data:

http://marketdata.websol.barchart.com/getQuote.json?key=44b2ab0b37a6436f26edebcc2da1794e&symbols=[symbol]

Replace symbol with the desired stock to retrieve its data:

http://marketdata.websol.barchart.com/getQuote.json?key=44b2ab0b37a6436f26edebcc2da1794e&symbols=GOOG

Use the [provided mockups](Stock_Watcher_Mockup.pdf) to guide your design.

## Criteria
* You are not allowed to use any CSS frameworks.
* You are welcome and encouraged to use any JavaScript libraries or frameworks eg (jQuery, Backone, Underscore, etc).
* The design must be implemented using HTML, CSS, custom fonts, and Javascript only. No images!
* The design should be responsive and change accordingly as the screen changes size.

## What we look for
* Well structured semantic HTML 5 code
* Well named, and organized CSS 3
* Good overall design (proper spacing, good use of contrast and color, general usability)
* Organized and easy-to-read Javascript

## Tips
* Make sure edge cases are handled well (eg. The user attempts to add stock symbol that does not exist)

When you are finished, upload your project to a public (free) GitHub repository on GitHub.com and email us the link to your work. Thanks!
