# Stock Watcher

Your task is to build a simple web application for a user to add basic stock tickers to a dashboard. To add a stock, the user enters the symbol of their desired stock eg. "GOOG" or "YHOO" into a text field. When they click "Add" the basic stock data is added to the dashboard.

Use the following Yahoo API to retrieve the stock data:
http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20yahoo.finance.quote%20WHERE%20symbol%20%3D%20'GOOG'&env=store%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltableswithkeys

Use the [provided mockups](Stock_Watcher_Mockup.pdf) and [finished design](Design2.png) to guide your development.

## Criteria
* You are not allowed to use any CSS frameworks.
* You are welcome and encouraged to use any JavaScript libraries or frameworks eg (jQuery, Backone, Underscore, etc).
* The design should be responsive and change accordingly as the screen changes size.

## What we look for
* Well structured semantic HTML 5 code
* Well named, and organized CSS 3
* Match the provided design as close as possible
* Organized and easy-to-read Javascript

## Tips
* Make sure edge cases are handled well (eg. The user attempts to add stock symbol that does not exist)
* The font used in the design is a free font from Google called 'Droid Serif'.

When you are finished, upload your project to a public (free) GitHub repository on GitHub.com and email us the link to your work. Thanks!
